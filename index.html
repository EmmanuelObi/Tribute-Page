          Malcolm X &nbsp;Who was an African American leader in the civil rights
          movement, minister and supporter of Black nationalism. He urged his
          fellow Black Americans to protect themselves against white aggression
          “by any means necessary,” a stance that often put him at odds with the
          nonviolent teachings of Martin Luther King, Jr.

        <h2>Malcolm X And The Nation Of Islam</h2>
        <p>
          After his release from prison Malcolm helped to lead the Nation of
          Islam during the period of its greatest growth and influence. He met
          Elijah Muhammad in Chicago in 1952 and then began organizing temples
          for the Nation in New York, Philadelphia, and Boston and in cities in
          the South. He founded the Nation’s newspaper, Muhammad Speaks , which
          he printed in the basement of his home, and initiated the practice of
          requiring every male member of the Nation to sell an assigned number
          of newspapers on the street as a recruiting and fund-raising
          technique. He also articulated the Nation’s racial doctrines on the
          inherent evil of whites and the natural superiority of Blacks.

        <p>
          Malcolm rose rapidly to become the minister of Boston Temple No. 11,
          which he founded; he was later rewarded with the post of minister of
          Temple No. 7 in Harlem, the largest and most prestigious temple in the
          Nation after the Chicago headquarters. Recognizing his talent and
          ability, Elijah Muhammad, who had a special affection for Malcolm,
          named him the National Representative of the Nation of Islam, second
          in rank to Muhammad himself. Under Malcolm’s lieutenancy, the Nation
          claimed a membership of 500,000. The actual number of members
          fluctuated, however, and the influence of the organization, refracted
          through the public persona of Malcolm X, always greatly exceeded its
          size.

          An articulate public speaker, a charismatic personality, and an
          indefatigable organizer, Malcolm X expressed the pent-up anger,
          frustration, and bitterness of African Americans during the major
          phase of the civil rights movement from 1955 to 1965. He preached on
          the streets of Harlem and spoke at major universities such as Harvard
          University and the University of Oxford. His keen intellect, incisive
          wit, and ardent radicalism made him a formidable critic of American
          society. He also criticized the mainstream civil rights movement,
          challenging Martin Luther King, Jr.’s central notions of integration
          and nonviolence. Malcolm argued that more was at stake than the civil
          right to sit in a restaurant or even to vote—the most important issues
          were Black identity, integrity, and independence. In contrast to
          King’s strategy of nonviolence, civil disobedience, and redemptive
          suffering, Malcolm urged his followers to defend themselves “by any
          means necessary.” His biting critique of the “so-called Negro”
          provided the intellectual foundations for the Black Power and Black
          consciousness movements in the United States in the late 1960s and
          ’70s (see Black nationalism). Through the influence of the Nation of
          Islam, Malcolm X helped to change the terms used to refer to African
          Americans from “Negro” and “coloured” to “Black” and “Afro-American.”
